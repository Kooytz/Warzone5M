# Warzone5M Project

It is a learning project aimed at recreating the game CoD: Warzone (2019) within the FiveM application, respecting the limitations of the different CoD x GTA V games. My main focus is to study user interfaces in order to try to recreate the MENUs within FiveM.

During pre-alpha development, the code will be open to anyone who wants to use it.
